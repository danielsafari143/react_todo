Most of us are pretty good at judging whether a project is relevant for us. We might not be the master of it but we might recognize that we’ve done something similar before and feel confident that we can pick it up and help.If you can’t find anything you think you are good at, consider looking at different projects that require less technical skill.If relevant for the project, you can also prepare some samples specific to the project to impress the client.The trick is to prepare some that are slightly different or watermarked, so they can’t use them in the project but close enough that they can see the potential If you like this project, kindly give it a star..
